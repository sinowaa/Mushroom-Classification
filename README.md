# Mushroom-cCassification
In this project, we will use a public dataset from kaggle.com, the “Mushroom Classification” dataset, and try to figure out if a mushroom is edible or not. This dataset includes descriptions of samples corresponding to 23 species of mushrooms. Each species is identified as edible or poisonous. When it comes to mushrooms, there is no simple rule for determining the edibility, and we have to be careful.
